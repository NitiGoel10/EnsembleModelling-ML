# EnsembleModelling-ML
Exploratory data analysis (visualization) and data cleaning. Finding best classification machine learning algorithm for the given dataset and predicting the best accuracy.
Machine Learning Algorithms used in this project to predict the best accuracy are Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM Algorithm and KNN Algorithm.
The final documentation of the analysis & the dataset has been attached among the files.
